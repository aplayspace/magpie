project: magpie 

project brief: magpie is a web app optimized for mobile that loads random web content into the app and allows users to 'black out' individual words, and also unblackout words they have blacked out in order to create a redacted text. The app should also allow users to screenshot and export their creations so they can share them on instagram if they like.  

project description: 
Redact is a bookmarklet that allows you to redact text on any webpage. You can use it however you want but one way people use it is to redact words in an online article. You can create interesting word combinations and new ideas simply by word redaction, which can lead to new discoveries and amusements.

Mary Ruefle has created poems through this process of ersasure, although she tends to use physical books and physical elisiion instruments like markers and white-out, as in her little delightful book, Little White Shadow.
